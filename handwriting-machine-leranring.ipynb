The project is implemented in Python and utilizes various libraries, including PyTorch and Tkinter.\n","\n","## Project Components\n","1. **Neural Network Model**\n","\n","   A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is defined using PyTorch. This model is designed for handwritten digit recognition.\n","\n","   The model consists of convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n","\n","2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**\n","\n","   The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed. It includes normalization and data augmentation for training.\n","\n","3. **Training**\n","\n","   The model is trained on the MNIST dataset. The training loop runs for a specified number of epochs, and the model is optimized using the Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy loss.\n","\n","4. **Saving and Loading Model**\n","\n","   The trained model is saved to a file for later use.\n","\n","5. **GUI for Digit Recognition**\n","\n","   A GUI is created using the Tkinter library, allowing users to draw digits on a canvas.\n","\n","6. **Digit Prediction**\n","\n","   The drawn digit is processed, resized to the appropriate dimensions, and converted into a PyTorch tensor.\n","\n","   The trained model is used to predict the digit, and the result is displayed to the user.\n","\n","7. **Clear and Predict Buttons**\n","\n","   The GUI features buttons to clear the canvas and initiate the digit prediction.\n","\n","## How to Use\n","1. Execute the Python code and remove the comments in the code section.\n","2. The GUI will appear, allowing you to draw a digit on the canvas.\n","3. Click the \"Clear\" button to erase the drawing and start over.\n","4. Click the \"Predict\" button to have the model recognize and display the predicted digit.\n","\n","This project combines machine learning, computer vision, and GUI development to create an interactive handwritten digit recognition tool. Users can draw digits, and the model predicts the written number, making it a great demonstration of AI in action.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"d99c81eb","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-13T21:09:40.904026Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-13T21:09:40.903357Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-13T21:09:44.731838Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-13T21:09:44.730733Z"},"papermill":{"duration":3.834504,"end_time":"2023-10-13T21:09:44.734283","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-13T21:09:40.899779","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["#

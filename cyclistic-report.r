SQL queries were instrumental in aggregating, summarizing, and extracting valuable patterns and trends from the dataset. Additionally, I created pivot tables to gain further insights into user behavior and bike usage patterns.\n","\n","<strong>Graphical Representation:</strong>\n","To present the findings effectively, I utilized Microsoft Excel to generate a series of informative visualizations. Excel's user-friendly interface allowed me to create polished graphs, charts, and plots, showcasing key trends and relationships within the data.\n","\n","# Introduction\n","\n","-   Cyclistic is a bike-share program that was launched in 2016 in
